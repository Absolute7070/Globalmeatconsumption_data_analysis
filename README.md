# Data analysis: Relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy

## Description 
It is nearly established scientific fact that consuming too much meat is harmful to our health. I explore if there is a correlation between life expectancy (as an indicator of health) and meat consumption.  I used data from Wikipedia and other websites to get meat consumption of different countries and their life expectancy at birth.

Positive and significant correlation between meat consumption and life expectancy. Which is against the scientific fact. But maybe wealthiness of countries have influenced the result
